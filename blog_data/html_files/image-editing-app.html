    The motivation for creating this project was a easy way to make
    images that are a fixed size for a web page. For instance, if I need
    an image that is 1440 pixels by 440 pixels I want to be able to easy load
    up an image, move a box that is that size around the image and
    then save the part of the image that is in the box.
