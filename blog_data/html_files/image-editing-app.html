    The motivation for creating this project was a easy way to make
    image that are a fixed size for a web page. For instance, if I need
    an image that is 1440 pixels by 440 pixels I want to be able to easy load
    up an image, move a box that is that size around the image and
    then save the part of the image that is in that box. 
</p>

<p>
    With other software I did not find a application that allowed me to
    move a specified box size around the image and only but out that section,
    so I built one.

    This article will go into some detail on a few of the aspects of this application.
    The final application can be found in the link below.
    <div style="text-align: center;">

            style="font-size: 20px; padding: 10px; text-decoration: none; border-radius: 5px;"
