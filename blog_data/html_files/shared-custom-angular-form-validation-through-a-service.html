<p>
    Recently for work I needed to validate some custom validators within an Angular project.
    The validators had been written within a service file that could then be shared through
    out the project. I was not 100% sure how the validators behaved so I decided to write some
    Jasmine tests to understand how these validators worked and document some cases that passed
    and failed. I learn a useful way to write a shared service for form model validation and 
    write tests to validate the validators.
</p>

<p>
    This blog post will be giving an overview of how to setup a custom service that can be used
    through an Angular project to validate form model inputs. Then I will go into how to test
    those custom validators with Jasmine. 
</p>

<h2>
    Creating Our Angular Project
</h2>

<p>
    We will be creating a new Angular project to show how to create this shared service. Create
    you angular project with:

    <div class="w3-code notranslate">
        ng new shared-form-validation <br>
        ? Would you like to add Angular routing? No <br>
        ? Which stylesheet format would you like to use? CSS
    </div>

    I'm currently use angular this version of angular.

    <div class="w3-code notranslate">
    C:\>ng version <br>
    <br>
    Angular CLI: 13.3.1<br>
    Node: 14.18.1<br>
    Package Manager: npm 8.6.0<br>
    OS: win32 x64
    </div>
</p>

<h2>
    Creating Our Service
</h2>

<p>
    I will be creating a custom validator for American Social Security Numbers.
    A Social Security Number is composed of three numbers, "dash", two numbers,
    "dash", four numbers. <br>
    Ex: 111-11-1111 
</p>

<p>
    We will create our service through the Angular CLI tool.

    <div class="w3-code notranslate">
        C:\>ng generate service validation <br>
        CREATE src/app/validation.service.spec.ts (377 bytes) <br>
        CREATE src/app/validation.service.ts (139 bytes) 
    </div>

    This will create the <code class="w3-codespan">validation.service.ts</code> where our
    validation code will live and the <code class="w3-codespan">validation.service.spec.ts</code>
    testing file. Lets first write out the validation spec for our social security numbers.
</p>

<p>
    A regex expression will be used to validate the text entered in on the form.
    The regex expression looks like this: <br>
    <code class="w3-codespan">/^[0-9]{3}\-[0-9]{2}\-[0-9]{4}$/</code>.
</p>

<p>
    Our validator will also use the <code class="w3-codespan">'@angular/forms'</code>
    <code class="w3-codespan">AbstractControl</code>
    class so that it can be passed in as needed to any angular reactive form class
    in the angular project.
</p>

<p>
    So our angular validation service will look like this:<br>

    <div class="w3-container w3-center">
        <img class="w3-image" src="../static/images/image0001.png">
    </div>
    
</p>

<h2>
    Testing Our Validation Service
</h2>

<p>
    No we will go about testing out <code class="w3-codespan">ssnValidator</code> within our
    <code class="w3-codespan">validation.service.ts</code>. The first step I do within the
    <code class="w3-codespan">validation.service.spec.ts</code> is to remove the test bed
    configurations since the testing of the form validator doesn't need a component generated.
    We will use a new <code class="w3-codespan">FormControl</code> for the validation testing.
</p>

<p>
    The first two tests will test if the service can be created and second test that
    the input "111-11-1111" is a valid input.<br>

    <div class="w3-container  w3-center">
        <img class="w3-image" src="../static/images/image0002.png">
    </div>
</p>

<p>
    Next we will go onto testing four test cases that should be invalid.

    <div class="w3-container  w3-center">
        <img class="w3-image" src="../static/images/image0003.png">
    </div>
</p>

<P>
    Now we can run our tests at the command line and see if they pass.
    <div class="w3-code notranslate">
        C:\>ng test <br>
    </div><br>

    <div class="w3-container  w3-center">
        <img class="w3-image" src="../static/images/image0004.png">
    </div>
    
    They all passed!
</P>

<h3>
    Using Our Service in a Reactive Form
</h3>

<p>
    Now we have a tested form validator lets create a reactive form to use it. Our first step
    is to add the <code class="w3-codespan">ReactiveFormsModule</code> within the
    <code class="w3-codespan">app.module.ts</code> so it can be used within a component.
    <br>
    <div class="w3-container  w3-center">
        <img class="w3-image" src="../static/images/image0005.png">
    </div>
</p>

<p>
    Generate the component that will house our Reactive Form.
    <div class="w3-code notranslate">
        C:\>ng generate component form
    </div>
</p>

<p>
    Now we will setup our form to accept the custom validation from our service and display an
    error message if the Social Security number input is not valid.<br>

    <div class="w3-container  w3-center">
        <img class="w3-image" src="../static/images/image0006.png">
    </div>
</p>

<p>
    This is the final view from the browser.

    <div class="w3-container  w3-center">
        <img class="w3-image" src="../static/gif/animation0001.gif">
    </div>
</p>
