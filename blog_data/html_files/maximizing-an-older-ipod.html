    My daughter was give an older iPod touch fourth-generation with 6.4 Gb of storage. This is great little device since
    it has a built in camera, she can listen to music, record audio, and watch videos. She loves to run around just 
    capturing what she sees. We had a trip coming up that would involve being on a plane for 4 hours and I wanted to put
    some of her favorite shows on her iPod to watch on the plane while traveling.

    In an effort to maximize the amount of videos that I could fit on the device I turned to using FFmpeg to reduce the
    mp4 video files down to a resolution that was watchable on the iPod. With a quick google search I found that I could use
    the <code class="language-sh">scale</code> command to set a smaller video scale. My original video was a 720x480
    pixel mp4 file. I could reduce those video down to a smaller 480x360 or 240x180 video size to help with saving space.
    Below is a list of those FFmpeg scale commands.

<pre><code class="language-sh"># 720p
ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -s 720x480 -c:a copy output.mp4
# 480p
ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -s 480x360 -c:a copy ouput.mp4
# 240p
ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -s 240x180 -c:a copy ouput.mp4</code></pre>

    I watched both the 480x360 and 240x180 resolutions on the iPod. I have to say the 480x360 is much
    better to watch but the 240x180
    is watchable. My 5 year old daughter didn't seem to care between the two so I went with the 240x180 resolution. 
    I compared the final file sizes between the three videos and found with the 240x180 resolution I could reduce the
    storage needed by 43%. Again, not a good video quality but now I could now get roughly 7.31 hrs of video per 1 GB of storage.
    This is a lot of value to my daughter per GB of storage.
