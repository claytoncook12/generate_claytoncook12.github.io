<h2>What is Entity Framework Core (EF Core)?</h2>

<p>
    EF Core is an object-relational mapper (ORM) that acts as a bridge between .NET objects and a relational database.
    The benefit in using an ORM is that you an interact with objects within your code instead of using SQL statements.

<h2>Relational Database Design General Concepts</h2>
<p>
    A few short database design concepts that I picked up from the Database Design and Basic SQL in PostgreSQL
    (University of Michigan) course on Coursera.
    <ul>
        <li>Start With a Picture</li>
        <li>Don't store the same string data twice - use a relationship instead</li>
        <li>One thing in "real world" and only one thing in the database</li>
        <li>
            When creating a database start with the most central object (generally the user object)
            and build your relationships out
        </li>
    </ul>
</p>

<p>
    Three types of keys
    <ul>
        <li>Primary Key - generally an integer auto-increment field</li>
        <li>Logical Key - what outside world uses for lookup</li>
        <li>Foreign Key - generally an integer key pointing to a row in another table</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<p>
    Data Normalization
    <ul>
        <li>Do not replicate data, point to data</li>
        <li>Use integers for Keys and for reference</li>
    </ul>
</p>
