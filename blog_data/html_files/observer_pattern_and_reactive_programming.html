<p>
    I'm currently reading through <i>The Pragmatic Programmer</i> (<i>PP</i>) by David Thomas and
    Andrew Hunt. In Chapter 5 "Bend, or Break" the <b>Observer Pattern</b> was discussed
    and how it related to RxJS and Reactive Programming. I currently use Angular as
    the main front end framework at work and the concepts of the Observer Pattern and
    Reactive programming are extremely important for having a mental framework of how
    to use Angular effectively. This blog post will dig is a discussion of
    the Observer pattern, how it related to RxJS, and give some coding examples.
</p>

<h2>What is the Observer Pattern</h2>

<div class="w3-panel w3-leftbar w3-light-grey">
    <p class="w3-xlarge w3-serif">
        <i>"In the observer pattern we have a source of
            events, called the <b>observable</b> and a list of clients,
            the <b>observers</b>, who are interested in
            those events."</i>
    </p>
    <p>The Pragmatic Programmer</p>
</div>

<p>
    So the main flow is such:
<ol>
    <li>An observable maintains a list of callback functions</li>
    <li>Clients then register their callback functions to be put on the observable's list</li>
    <li>
        When an event occurs the observable iterates through
        the list and executes those callback functions.
    </li>
</ol>
</p>

<h2>Creating An Observer in Javascript</h2>

<p>
    I'm going to create an Observer in JavaScript to clarify how this works.

<h3>Draw Backs To The Observer Method</h3>
<h2>Next Steps With Publish/Subscribe</h2>
<h3>RxJS Observable - The Observer Pattern Standardized</h3>

<p>
    RxJS has Standardized the Observer Pattern with its <code class="w3-codespan">Observer</code>
    object. The <code class="w3-codespan">Observer</code> object is the basic building block
    within RxJS and is an object that can emit values at any time and provides
    a means to update subscribers of those updates.

<h2>Reactive Programming with Vanilla RxJS and Webpack</h2>

    <b>Temp Notes for section</b><br>
    <i>"In particular, an observable can be piped through an operator, which could change either the values emitted, the timing/number of emitted events, or both."</i>
