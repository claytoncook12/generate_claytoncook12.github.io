<p>
    I'm currently reading through <i>The Pragmatic Programmer</i> (<i>PP</i>) by David Thomas and
    Andrew Hunt. In Chapter 5 "Bend, or Break" the <b>Observer Pattern</b> was discussed
    and how it related to RxJS and Reactive Programming. I currently use Angular as
    the main front end framework at work and the concepts of the Observer Pattern and
    Reactive programming are extremely important for having a mental framework of how
    to use Angular effectively. This blog post will discussion
    the Observer pattern, how it related to RxJS, and give some coding examples.
</p>

<h2>What is the Observer Pattern</h2>

<div class="w3-panel w3-leftbar w3-light-grey">
    <p class="w3-xlarge w3-serif">
        <i>"In the observer pattern we have a source of
            events, called the <b>observable</b> and a list of clients,
            the <b>observers</b>, who are interested in
            those events."</i>
    </p>
    <p>The Pragmatic Programmer</p>
</div>

<p>
    So the main flow is such:
<ol>
    <li>An observable maintains a list of callback functions</li>
    <li>Clients then register their callback functions to be put on the observable's list</li>
    <li>
        When an event occurs the observable iterates through
        the list and executes those callback functions.
    </li>
</ol>
</p>

<h2>Creating An Observable in Javascript</h2>

<p>
    I'm going to create an Observable in JavaScript to clarify how this works.
</p>

<p>
    <figcaption class="w3-center">
        The Observer Pattern in Vanilla Javascript
    </figcaption>
    <pre><code class="language-js">class Observable {
    // Callback List
    constructor() {
        this.functionArray = []
    }

    // Add Callback to Callback List
    register(callback) {
        this.functionArray.push(callback)
    }

    // Some Event Happens
    event1(number) {
        // Loop through All Callbacks
        for (var i = 0; i < this.functionArray.length; i++) {
            this.functionArray[i](number);
        }
    }
}

function callback1(number) {
    console.log(`Callback1: value ${number}`)
}

function callback2(number) {
    console.log(`Callback2: value ${number}`)
}

const Observer1 = new Observable();
Observer1.register(callback1);
Observer1.register(callback2);
Observer1.event1(99);</code></pre>

<figcaption class="w3-center">
    Process Output
</figcaption>
<pre><code class="language-powershell"></code>C:\node observer.js
Callback1: value 99
Callback2: value 99</pre>
</p>

<p>
    So in this code example the <code class="w3-codespan">Observable</code> maintains a list of callback functions
    that are then called when <code class="w3-codespan">event1</code> is triggered. This pattern is especially
    useful when we want multiple actions to occur when a User interaction happens. The Observer pattern allows
    for a clear chaining of multiple actions to an initiating event.
</p>

<p>
    As is mentioned in PP, the Observer pattern has baked in coupling since the callbacks are handled inline
    by the observable and if the registered callbacks initiate synchronously then this can cause
    a code bottleneck. To address these issues we can pull the code related to connecting the Observer and
    Client into channels that are maintained separately. This moves our Observer pattern into a more
    generalized form called <b>Publish/Subscribe (Pubsub)</b>. This address decoupling and introduces the 
    possibility for asynchronous processing of callbacks. So with <b>Pubsub</b> we have publishers, subscribers,
    and channels that connect the two.  
</p>

<p>
    One of the most popular coding libraries that implement this PubSub Observer Pattern is RxJS.
</p>

</div>

<h2>RxJS Observable - The Observer Pattern Standardized</h2>

<p>
    RxJS has Standardized the Observer Pattern with its <code class="w3-codespan">Observer</code>
    object. The <code class="w3-codespan">Observer</code> object is the basic building block
    within RxJS and is an object that can emit values at any time and provides
    a means to update subscribers of those updates.
</p>

<h3>RxJS and Vanilla Javascript</h3>

<p class="w3-yellow">
    Do I include Reactive Programming in this section since I've only been
    talking about the Observer Pattern?
</p>

<p>
    We will create the previous code example with <code class="ws-codespan">RxJS</code> version 7.8.1 and import
    that into our JavaScript file like so.  
</p>

<p>
    <b>Temp Example with Vanilla JavaScript no Webpack</b>
    <figcaption class="w3-center">
        Importing RxJS in Vanilla JavaScript File
    </figcaption>
    <pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-html">&#60;script src="https://unpkg.com/rxjs@7.8.1/dist/bundles/rxjs.umd.min.js"&#62;&#60;/script&#62;

const {Observable, from } = rxjs;
    </code></pre>
</p>

<p>
    <b>Temp Notes for section</b><br>
    <i>"In particular, an observable can be piped through an operator, which could change either the values emitted, the timing/number of emitted events, or both."</i>
</p>
