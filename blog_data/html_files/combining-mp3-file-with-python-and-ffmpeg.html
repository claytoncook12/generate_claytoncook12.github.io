    I love listening to audio books. My local library has a very good selection of
    audio books on cd and I found my self burning a lot of audio cds into mp3 files.
    Once I had the files downloaded I was wanting an easy way to combine all the audio
    files from the cd collection into a single audio file so I didn't have to worry
    about keeping track of the individuals files.

    So the solution I came up with was to write a python script that could issue a
    command line call to <a href="https://ffmpeg.org/" target="_blank">FFmpeg</a>
    after scanning the current directory for all <code class="w3-codespan">mp3</code>
    files. What I came up with is below.

    <pre>
<code class="language-py">// combine-audio-files.py
import os

def run():
    filenames = []

    for filename in os.listdir(os.getcwd()):
        if (filename.endswith(".mp3")):
            filenames.append(filename)
        else:
            continue

    filenames_string = "".join([str(filename+'|') for filename in filenames])

    ran_code = os.system(f'ffmpeg -i "concat:{filenames_string}" -acodec copy output.mp3')
    print(ran_code)
    
if __name__ == '__main__':
    run()</code></pre>
