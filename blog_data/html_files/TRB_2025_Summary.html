    Back in November of 2024 I started as an engineer for the Kentucky Transportation Center (KTC).
    As part of working here I was able to attend the Transportation Research Board (TRB) national
    meeting that is held in Washington, DC. The TRB conference covers all modes of Transportation
    and attracts thousands of transportation administrators, practitioners, policy makers, and 
    researchers.
</p>

<p>
    As a first time attendee it was a little overwhelming due to the shear number of
    possible presentations and posters to go see. As well as possible Committee and Sub Committee
    meetings to attend. I ended up focusing on topics that covered highway infrastructure assets,
    asphalt performance and condition evaluation, recycled material use in pavements, 
    ground improvement modeling and performance in roadways embankments, instrumentation of roadways
    and soils and pile axial capacity modeling and instrumentation. Overall, it was a wonderful
    experience that allowed me to get a sense of the state of practice in the transportation industry
    and transportation agencies as well as current areas of research.

<h3>Key Take Aways</h3>

<ol>
    <li>
        FHWA has on online portal of data, knowledge, analytical tools related to pavement, bridges
        and materials. The portal is free to access. 
        <a href="https://infohighway.fhwa.dot.gov/">infohighway.fhwa.dot.gov</a>. I plan to dig deeper
        into the data through this portal and hopefully get more familiar with the FHWA Long-Term Pavement
        Performance (LTPP) data that is housed there. (Lecture 1019, Sunday 9 am)
    </li>
    <li>
        Uniform support underneath concrete asphalt pavements is more critical to long-term
        performance than the strength or stiffness of the foundation. (Lecture 1047, 1:30 pm)
        (Resources: <a href="https://rosap.ntl.bts.gov/view/dot/28440">Guidance for improving 
            foundation layers to increase pavement performance on local roads.</a>,
            <a href="https://trid.trb.org/View/367534">SUBGRADES AND SUBBASES FOR CONCRETE PAVEMENTS</a>
        )
    </li>

        Presentation on the use of Marine Electrical Resistivity Surveys to look at scours holes in 
        bridges was an interesting idea I had not seen before. Presentation by Andrew Gombac, Texas State University.
    </li>
    <li>
        Learned about a new program at Western Kentucky University that presented presentation and posters
        at TRB,
            <a href="https://www.wku.edu/ctr/" target="_blank">WKU Center for Transportation Research (CTR) Facility</a>
        that is run by Dr. Kirolos Haleem's. Looks to be very active.
    </li>
    <li>
        Learned about asset management and life cycle cost analysis related to pavement. Very interesting presentations
        given in lecture session 3075 Decision Making in Pavement Materials, Tuesday 10:15 am. Interesting application
        of Monte Carlo Simulation and Markov Condition Modeling to estimate life-cycle costs for pavement performance.
        <ul>
            <li>Probability Based Pavement Asset Management in Ireland, Mr. Ray McGowan, PMS Pavement Management Services Ltd.</li>

        </ul>

    <li>
        Pavement instrumentation subcommittee had some great presentations.
