    In this recording I walked through the process of creating an aerial image using a drone.
    My project focused on a boat ramp in Kentucky, where we're working on improvements following a dam removal.
    I share how I collected and processed drone images to create both a 2D aerial photo.
</p>
<p>
    I started by showcasing the final aerial image. I explain my drone flight
    planning process using Drone Link, detailing how I set up the drone mission, including flight paths, altitude, and 
    speed adjustments to ensure proper photo capture.
</p>
<p>
    After flying the mission with my DJI Mini 2 drone, I gathered a series of images. I used ground control points to help
    ensure accuracy, which I surveyed with a total station on site right before the drone flight.
    The next step involved processing these images with Web ODM Lightning, where I uploaded the photos and
    waited for the processing to complete.
</p>
<p>
    Once the model was ready, I moved to AutoCAD, where I used Carlson Civil Suite to georeference the aerial image. I detailed
    how to input control points, scale the image accurately, and adjust it until it aligned properly with my surveyed points.
</p>
<p>
    Finally, I exported the georeferenced image and demonstrated how to import it back into AutoCAD, verifying that everything
    lined up correctly. Overall, I hope this breakdown provides a clear understanding of the entire process from planning to execution.
